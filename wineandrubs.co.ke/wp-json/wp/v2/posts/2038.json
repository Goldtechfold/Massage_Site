This type of massage is designed to create balance among the mind, body, and spirit, and help the body heal itself. It\u2019s sometimes referred to as an \u201coil massage\u201d because it typically incorporates warm herb essential oils, as well as time-honored and non-traditional strokes and kneading that suit an individual\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Is Ayurvedic Massage Different From Other Kinds of Massage?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several factors set Ayurvedic massage apart from other kinds of massage, such as Therapeutic and Swedish:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ayurvedic Oils<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ayurveda, the five elements that are found in all living things\u2014space, air, fire, water, and earth\u2014are considered the building blocks of life. These combine to create three mind-body principles, known as\u00a0<strong>doshas<\/strong>, within the body:\u00a0<em><strong>Vata<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0(air and space),\u00a0<strong><em>Pitta<\/em>\u00a0<\/strong>(fire and water), and\u00a0<em><strong>Kapha<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0(water and earth). Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas, although one is usually more dominant. Ayurvedic practices balance of the doshas to govern one\u2019s physical and emotional health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During an Ayurvedic massage, organic oil blends are infused with Ayurvedic herbs and heated to promote relaxation and detoxification. The oils are chosen to balance a person\u2019s dominant dosha. At the right temperature, these oils enter the body through the skin and pores, bind to the\u00a0<em><strong>ama<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0(toxins), and are released to detoxify the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison, Therapeutic massage incorporates oil primarily to facilitate relaxing strokes on the skin. And Thai massage uses no oil, which is why people are able to leave their clothes on during this kind of massage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Energy and Intention<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An Ayurvedic therapist focuses on clearing the energy channels in the body, moving and dislodging toxins, and balancing the\u00a0<strong>chakras<\/strong>\u00a0(energy centers).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thai massage also works with the energy centers of the body. With Therapeutic massage, however, the approach focuses more on core anatomy and physiology rather than body energy lines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Specific Movements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The style and flow of an Ayurvedic massage are determined by what an individual needs. The massage therapist will typically use massage techniques including tapping, kneading, and squeezing, as well as traditional massage strokes. Movement flow can be quick or drawn out, depending on a person\u2019s needs. The overall approach increases circulation and lymphatic drainage. Some spas provide two therapists working on one person simultaneously. At Wine And Rubs We Provide only one therapist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thai massage works with compression\u2014in addition to pulling, stretching, and rocking\u2014that\u2019s directed into muscle tissues by either the hands or fingers. Thai massage usually takes place on a mat on the floor, and the person receiving the massage wears loose or stretchy clothing. The massage therapist is also on the mat and moves the person\u2019s entire body into various stretches and positions. Swedish massage centers on relieving muscle tension through soft, long, kneading strokes, as well as light, rhythmic, tapping strokes, on the topmost layers of muscles. This is also combined with movement of the joints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are the Various Kinds of Ayurvedic Massage?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several kinds of Ayurvedic massage. Among some of the more popular therapies are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Abhyanga (abee-yan-ga)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most traditional Ayurvedic treatments,&nbsp;<em>abhyanga<\/em>&nbsp;uses friction-based strokes and warm dosha-specific oils. As the oil is massaged into the skin, it penetrates the tissues to loosen toxins at a cellular level. This style of massage promotes circulation, boosts immune system function, and creates deep relaxation in the mind and body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gandharva (gaan-darva)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Gandharva<\/em>\u00a0combines touch with sound therapy to improve energy flow. During this kind of massage, the therapist uses warm, herbal oils and\u00a0crystal singing bowls to vibrate and transform the body\u2019s cells. This treatment promotes vitality and blissfulness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marma<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Marma<\/em>&nbsp;points are vital life or energy points among the body, mind, and emotions. During a&nbsp;<em>marma<\/em>&nbsp;massage, dosha-specific essential oils are combined with a light, circular touch to stimulate these energy points.&nbsp;<em>Marma<\/em>&nbsp;massage awakens the body\u2019s inner healing system, manipulates subtle energy or&nbsp;<em>prana<\/em>, relieves stiff muscles, and boosts circulation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Odyssey Ayurvedic Massage Treatment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This treatment includes five Ayurvedic techniques and is intended to work on the entire system\u2014mental, physical, and energetic. It\u2019s done by one or two massage therapists. It begins with\u00a0<em><strong>Garshana<\/strong><\/em>, a dry-glove exfoliation that starts the detoxification process, stimulates the lymphatic system, and prepares the skin to absorb the oils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then comes\u00a0<em>Abhyanga<\/em>, in which the body is covered in warm herbalized oil from scalp to toes with friction strokes that move the oil into the tissues to loosen and dislodge\u00a0<em>ama<\/em>\u00a0(toxins). Next, the slow, deep, penetrating strokes of\u00a0<em>Vishesh<\/em> promote relaxation. The treatment concludes with\u00a0<em>Marma (see description above)\u00a0<\/em>and chakra balancing, using dosha-specific essential oils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pizichilli (pitzi-chilli)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pizichilli<\/em>&nbsp;is typically performed by two massage therapists. It\u2019s also sometimes referred to as an \u201coil bath,\u201d as continuous warm streams of herbal oil are rhythmically smoothed into the body. This treatment warms, lubricates, and nourishes to enhance circulation, eliminate toxins, and purify the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shirodhara (shiro-dar-a)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Shirodhara<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0is a meditative and tranquil treatment centered on a soothing stream of warm oil that\u2019s gently poured over the forehead and onto the\u00a0<strong>third eye chakra<\/strong>, the energetic center of intuition that\u2019s also known as\u00a0<em><strong>ajna<\/strong><\/em>. This treatment is known to calm the central nervous system, and integrate the mind and body. After experiencing\u00a0<em>shirodhara<\/em>, some say they feel a sense of restful awareness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vishesh (vi-shesh)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Vishesh<\/em>&nbsp;is another rhythmic massage technique. It uses firm, slow strokes to elongate contracted muscles, break up adhesions, and help release deep-seated impurities. Little oil is used. If it follows&nbsp;<em>Abhyanga<\/em>&nbsp;massage, much of the surface oil is removed. This allows for a higher level of friction on the skin and deeper access to the tissues. Following a&nbsp;<em>Vishesh<\/em>&nbsp;massage, some say they feel light, loose, and relaxed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Kind of Ayurvedic Massage Is Best for Each Dosha?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imbalances are treated with their opposites in Ayurveda, therefore most Ayurvedic massages focus on countering a person\u2019s predominant dosha.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kapha<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When&nbsp;<em>Kapha<\/em>&nbsp;types are in balance, they have sturdy builds, vigor, healthy digestion, and an overall sense of calm.&nbsp;<em>Kaphas<\/em>&nbsp;approach life\u2019s stressors with ease and grace. Excess&nbsp;<em>Kapha<\/em>&nbsp;dosha, however, can result in lethargy, obesity, apathy, and depression. Digestion suffers, and allergies and respiratory problems may arise. As a result,&nbsp;<em>Kaphas<\/em>&nbsp;can become stubborn and resistant to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of a lethargy tendency,\u00a0<em>Kaphas<\/em>\u00a0often benefit from deep-tissue, stimulating massage, such as\u00a0<em>Vishesh<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pitta<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When in balance,&nbsp;<em>Pittas<\/em>&nbsp;tend to be joyful, friendly, and energetic. They tend to be of medium size and weight, and have strong digestion. The&nbsp;<em>Pitta<\/em>&nbsp;mind is clear and focused so long as it\u2019s in balance. Out of balance, however,&nbsp;<em>Pittas&nbsp;<\/em>experience a lack of focus, increased stomach acid that can result in ulcers, constant thirst, irritability, temper outbursts, fever, and inflammation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayurvedic massages such as Abhyanga and Odyssey can help pacify Pittas by releasing toxins and calming their central nervous systems.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vata<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Vatas<\/em>&nbsp;tend to be always on the go, and have an energetic and creative mind. When&nbsp;<em>Vatas<\/em>&nbsp;are in balance, they will be lively and enthusiastic, with a thin frame and excellent agility. Energy comes in bursts and they are likely to experience sudden bouts of fatigue. When the&nbsp;<em>Vata<\/em>&nbsp;dosha becomes imbalanced, it manifests in the body as weight loss, constipation, hypertension, arthritis, weakness, restlessness, and digestive challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shirodhara<\/em>, Odyssey, and Marma help to balance\u00a0<em>Vata<\/em>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a person receives a massage that doesn\u2019t suit their dosha, it can lead to greater imbalance both physically and emotionally. If you don\u2019t know what your dosha is, take this\u00a0dosha quiz\u00a0to find out so you can ensure you explore a massage option that\u2019s right for you.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are the Benefits of Ayurvedic Massage?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as Ayurveda is prevention-oriented, so is Ayurvedic massage. In general, Ayurvedic massage can help:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Boost body awareness<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clear physiological and energetic pathways<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create deep relaxation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Detoxify and cleanse<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhance the immune system<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Help those with medical conditions better their overall well-being<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improve circulation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increase vitality, rejuvenating, and repairing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep healthy people in good health<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Balance&nbsp;<em>Vata<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Pitta<\/em>, and&nbsp;<em>Kapha<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Promote healthy skin<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduce stress<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Soothe the body and mind<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, massage is combined with other Ayurveda principles, such as diet and\u00a0<strong>nutrition<\/strong>, and\u00a0<strong>exercise<\/strong>, for maximum benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where to Get an Ayurvedic Massage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t have to travel to India to get an Ayurvedic massage. There are few spas in Kenya that offer these specialized treatments. Just be sure to find a licensed massage therapist that is also trained specifically in Ayurvedic techniques.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are based\u00a0in Nairobi, Kenya, specialises in Ayurvedic massage, and its\u00a0Perfect Health program\u00a0offers a different massage each day. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If going to a spa isn\u2019t your thing, you can book yourself an Abhyanga at home. A\u00a0daily Abhyanga practice\u00a0is known to restore the balance of the doshas,\u00a0boost the immune system, and enhance overall well-being and longevity. Regular Abhyanga grounds and relaxes\u00a0<em>Vata<\/em>\u00a0dosha imbalances, but anyone can benefit from it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should You Get or Self-Practice Ayurvedic Massage?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ayurveda, it\u2019s considered that there\u2019s no greater expression of self-love than being anointed head to toe with warm oil\u2014or by\u00a0massaging oneself with oil. It can nourish the body, reinstate the balance of doshas, and improve one\u2019s well-being and longevity. Because Ayurvedic massage is tailored to an individual\u2019s wellness needs, it\u2019s generally considered safe and beneficial when done by a qualified person. Or, if you\u2019re going to try it on yourself, be sure to use a\u00a0dosha-balancing oil for your needs and read the instructions for the self-Abhyanga before you get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0<em>The information in this article is intended for your educational use only; it does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Wine &#8216;N&#8217; Rubs; and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
