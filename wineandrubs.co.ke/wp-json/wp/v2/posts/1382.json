In this article, we look at both sides of the debate to help people understand the potential risks and benefits of CST.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a>What is craniosacral therapy?<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cdn-prod.medicalnewstoday.com\/content\/images\/articles\/318\/318490\/woman-having-head-and-neck-massaged.jpg?w=1155&amp;h=1541\" alt=\"Woman having head and neck massaged.\"\/><figcaption>Craniosacral therapy involves applying gentle pressure and manipulation to the joints in the skull, spine, and parts of the pelvis.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>CST is a non-invasive, hands-on therapy that aims to enhance the body\u2019s own healing capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.upledger.com\/therapies\/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Upledger Institute<\/a>, CST uses a touch of under 5 grams to \u201crelease restrictions in the craniosacral system to improve the functioning of the&nbsp;central nervous system.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This light touch is said to affect the pressure and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, which is the fluid around the brain and spinal cord. This process is thought to relieve pain and dysfunction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practitioners claim that CST can be carried out as a standalone treatment or used in conjunction with medical or other alternative therapies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a>Uses<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cdn-prod.medicalnewstoday.com\/content\/images\/articles\/318\/318490\/doctor-pointing-at-a-model-of-the-spine.jpg?w=1155&amp;h=1541\" alt=\"Doctor pointing at a model of the spine.\"\/><figcaption>Craniosacral therapy can help to improve the functioning of the nervous system, relieving pain and improving mobility.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>CST has been used to treat a variety of conditions, both physical and psychological.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.upledger.com\/therapies\/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Upledger Institute<\/a>&nbsp;lists the following disorders as suitable for treatment with CST:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Alzheimer\u2019s disease<\/li><li>autism<\/li><li>back pain<\/li><li>brain injury<\/li><li>central nervous system\u00a0disorders<\/li><li>chronic\u00a0fatigue<\/li><li>colic<\/li><li>concussion<\/li><li>dementia<\/li><li>fibromyalgia<\/li><li>immune disorders<\/li><li>learning disabilities<\/li><li>migraines<\/li><li>neck pain<\/li><li>post-traumatic stress disorder\u00a0(PTSD)<\/li><li>scoliosis<\/li><li>spinal cord injury<\/li><li>stress<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a>Effectiveness: Does it work?<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few studies have been carried out on the use of CST in the treatment of illness.
